### Step 2: Create a `README.md` File

A good project always has a `README.md` file to explain what it does. I've written one for you.

1.  Go to your main **`Project Isro`** folder.
2.  Create a new file and name it **`README.md`**.
3.  Paste the content from the file below into it.

### Step 3: Upload to GitHub

1.  **Create a GitHub Account** if you don't have one.
2.  Go to GitHub and click **"New repository"**.
3.  Give your repository a name (e.g., `maitri-ai-assistant`) and click **"Create repository"**. Do not add a README or .gitignore from the website.
4.  You will see a page with commands. Copy the repository URL (it ends with `.git`).
5.  Now, open a terminal in your main **`Project Isro`** folder and run these commands one by one:

    ```bash
    # Step 1: Initialize Git in your project
    git init -b main

    # Step 2: Add all your files to be tracked
    git add .

    # Step 3: Save your files with a message
    git commit -m "Initial commit of MAITRI AI Assistant"

    # Step 4: Link your local project to your GitHub repository
    git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE 
    # (Replace with the URL you copied from GitHub)

    # Step 5: Push your code to GitHub
    git push -u origin main
    
After these commands finish, refresh your GitHub page. All your project files will be there, ready to be shared!
